Instantiating and using
=============
To use the library you need [to generate a token](https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/chat/guides/identity) and pass it to the Chat Client factory.

Client instantiation looks as follows:
```
Twilio.Chat.Client.create(token).then(client => {
    // Use client
});
```

or, using async/await syntax:
```
let client = await Twilio.Chat.Client.create(token);
// Use client
```

Example above is minimal. Most likely you will want [to control token lifecycle as well with Access Manager](https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/chat/guides/access-token-lifecycle).

Consuming a library
=============
You can consume the library from NPM:
```
npm install twilio-chat
```

For browser you can use the version from CDN:
```html
<script src="https://media.twiliocdn.com/sdk/js/chat/v2.1/twilio-chat.min.js"></script>
```
